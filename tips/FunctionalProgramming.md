**Java.util.BiFunction:**

1. **Definition**: It's a function accepting two arguments and producing a result.
2. **Variability**: The types of arguments and return value can differ.

**Map Compute Methods:**

1. **compute**:
    - **Purpose**: Tries to compute a mapping for the provided key and its current mapped value.
    - **Example**:
      ```java
      map.compute(key, (k, v) -> (v == null) ? msg : v.concat(msg))
      ```
    - **Behavior**:
        - If the function returns null, the mapping is removed.
        - If the function throws an exception, it's rethrown, and the current mapping remains unchanged.
    - **Parameters**:
        - `key`: The key for which the value is to be associated.
        - `remappingFunction`: The function to compute a value.
    - **Returns**: The new value associated with the key, or null if none.

2. **computeIfAbsent**:
    - **Purpose**: Computes the value for the key if absent or mapped to null.
    - **Example**:
      ```java
      map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new Value(f(k)));
      ```
    - **Behavior**:
        - If the function returns null, no mapping is recorded.
        - If the function throws an exception, it's rethrown, and no mapping is recorded.
    - **Parameters**:
        - `key`: The key for which the value is to be associated.
        - `mappingFunction`: The function to compute a value.
    - **Returns**: The current (existing or computed) value associated with the specified key, or null if the computed value is null.

3. **computeIfPresent**:
    - **Purpose**: Computes a new mapping if the value for the key is present and non-null.
    - **Behavior**:
        - If the function returns null, the mapping is removed.
        - If the function throws an exception, it's rethrown, and the current mapping remains unchanged.
    - **Parameters**:
        - `key`: The key for which the value is to be associated.
        - `remappingFunction`: The function to compute a value.
    - **Returns**: The new value associated with the specified key, or null if none.
