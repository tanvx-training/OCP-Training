# JDBC

## Introducing Relational Databases and SQL

- A relational database is a database that is organized into tables, which consist of rows and columns. 
- There are two main ways to access a relational database from Java:
    + Java Database Connectivity Language (JDBC): Accesses data as rows and columns. JDBC is the API covered in this chapter.
    + Java Persistence API (JPA): Accesses data through Java objects using a concept called object-relational mapping (ORM). The idea is that you donâ€™t have to write as much code, and you get your data in Java objects. JPA is not on the exam, and therefore it is not covered in this chapter.
    + A relational database is accessed through Structured Query Language (SQL).

### Identifying the Structure of a Relational Database

### Writing Basic SQL Statements

There are four types of statements for working with the data in tables:
- INSERT: Add a new row to the table
- SELECT: Retrieve data from the table
- UPDATE: Change zero or more rows in the table 
- DELETE: Remove zero or more rows from the table

## Introducing the Interfaces of JDBC

- Need to know four key interfaces of JDBC.
- These concrete classes come from the JDBC driver.
- Each database has a different JAR file with these classes.

**Key JDBC interfaces**

- All database classes are in the package `java.sql`, so we will omit the imports going forward.
- Key JDBC interfaces:

| Object      | Description                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Driver      | Knows how to get a connection to the database |
| Connection  | Knows how to communicate with the database    |
| Statement   | Knows how to run the SQL                      |
| ResultSet   | Knows what was returned by a SELECT query     |

## Connecting to a Database

### Building a JDBC URL

- The JDBC URL format: *jdbc:postgres://localhost:5432/zoo*
- Protocol: *jdbc*
- Product/Vendor Name: *postgres*
- Database Specific Connection Details: *//localhost:5432/zoo*
- Colon Separators
