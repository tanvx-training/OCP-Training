You need to know the following facts about enums:
1. Enum constructor is always private. You cannot make it public or protected. If an enum type has no constructor declarations, then a private constructor that takes no parameters is automatically provided.
2. An enum is implicitly final, which means you cannot extend it.
3. You cannot extend an enum from another enum or class because an enum implicitly extends java.lang.Enum. But an enum can implement interfaces.
4. Since enum maintains exactly one instance of its constants, you cannot clone it. You cannot even override the clone method in an enum because java.lang.Enum makes it final.
5. Compiler provides an enum with two public static methods automatically -  values() and valueOf(String). The values method returns an array of its constants and valueOf method tries to match the String argument exactly (i.e. case sensitive) with an enum constant and returns that constant if successful otherwise it throws java.lang.IllegalArgumentException.

The following are a few more important facts about java.lang.Enum which you should know:

1. It implements java.lang.Comparable (thus, an enum can be added to sorted collections such as SortedSet, TreeSet, and TreeMap).
2. It has a method ordinal(), which returns the index (starting with 0) of that constant i.e. the position of that constant in its enum declaration.
3. It has a method name(), which returns the name of this enum constant, exactly as declared in its enum declaration.
