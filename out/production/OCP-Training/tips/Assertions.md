**Enabling and Disabling Assertions in Java:**

- Assertions can be enabled or disabled for specific packages or classes.
- To enable assertions for a specific class, use the class name. For a package, use the package name followed by "..." (three dots).

**Examples:**
- To enable assertions for a specific class:
  ```
  java -ea:<class> myPackage.MyProgram
  ```

- To disable assertions for a specific package and its subpackages:
  ```
  java -da:<package>... myPackage.MyProgram
  ```

- You can combine enabling and disabling assertions:
  ```
  java -ea -da:<package>... myPackage.MyProgram
  ```

- To enable assertions for one package and disable for another:
  ```
  java -ea:<package1>... -da:<package2>... myPackage.MyProgram
  ```

**Unnamed Root (Default) Package:**

- You can enable or disable assertions in the unnamed root package (the one in the current directory) using:
  ```
  java -ea:... myPackage.MyProgram
  java -da:... myPackage.MyProgram
  ```

**Package Name Usage in Flags:**

- When using a package name in the `-ea` or `-da` flag, it applies to the specified package and its subpackages.
- Example:
  ```
  java -ea:com... -da:com.enthuware... com.enthuware.Main
  ```
  This command enables assertions for all classes in the `com` package and its subpackages. Then, it disables assertions for classes in the `com.enthuware` package and its subpackages.
