A repository to keep track of the study guide on the OCP Java 8 book

The book I am going to cover here is the second part of the guide for Java 8 certification. The first guide covers OCA exam (which I already passed) and this guide covers OCP exam (1Z0-809 exam).

# OCA guide
My experience after reading the OCA study guide is positive and has encourage me to continue with the second part of the certification. It covers 100% of what you need to know to nail the exam but most importantly helps grasping the content in an effective way.  

# This notes
This notes are taken in order to help me learn all the topics covered in the book and to keep them somewhere safe and with a nice formating. There might be code snippets and solutions to arbitrary questions. Please bear in mind the notes are mainly for miself and that there will be typos.
